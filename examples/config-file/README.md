# Configuration file example

This example contains:

- A custom configuration file with a custom SASS importer. You should only need a custom importer if you also use one as part of your build tool.

The command to generate the proper type files would look like this (_in the root of this example, not repository_):

```bash
npm run typed-scss-modules "./**/*.scss"
```
