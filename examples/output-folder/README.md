# Output folder example

This example contains:

- A custom configuration file with a custom output folder. All type definitions will be generated in this directory.

The command to generate the proper type files would look like this (_in the root of this example, not repository_):

```bash
yarn typed-scss-modules "./**/*.scss"
```
